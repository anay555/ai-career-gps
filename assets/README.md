# Place brand assets here (not committed by default if you add to .gitignore)

- logo.png (recommended 512x512, transparent background)
- favicon.png (recommended 32x32)

Notes
- The app will automatically:
  - Use assets/favicon.png as the page icon if present; otherwise it falls back to an emoji.
  - Show assets/logo.png at the top of the sidebar if present.
- Do not commit licensed or sensitive images unless you have rights to do so.
